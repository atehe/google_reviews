I‚Äôve been so excited to try it out!Sadly from the moment I got there I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with the staff, the front of house staff ignored me for about 5 minutes, when they finally acknowledged me, they carried on with a separate conversation, which was a bit frustrating.We got seated and again there was a long delay before a server came over to greet us etc. This set the tone for the whole evening, everything about the service was very brash and slow. I asked for a blanket as I saw them being handed out to all the women and was told there were none left, yet 2 minutes later I saw another women being handed a blanket. I asked if we could be moved to near a heater IF one became available and the server angrily said ‚Äòwe have none available‚Äô gesturing to the whole dining area. I calmly reiterated my point, and he said yes whilst storming off (he did not let me know when a table came up and I had to be asked to be moved). No one asked us how our starters or mains were, and I had to ask to have our mains cleared (after they were sat for over half an hour) AND to order dessert. Honestly I was so disappointed with the service, however the only saving grace was the food and beverage!The food was lovely, the prawns and the Halibut were cooked to perfection and the balance of flavours were amazing. The cocktails were great too and the bar staff were so friendly and help when choosing a cocktail based on your flavour preference.The views and the decor are incredible and well worth a visit to the top.If the service up their game, this would be an absolutely incredible restaurant!",2021-08-19 02:20:25,"Dear Charisma,Thank you for your recent visit and for your time taking to write this review;We are sorry to hear about the lack of service you have received, however we are so pleased you did enjoy the food and drinks!Would you be able please to email us at hello@14hills.co.uk so we can investigate this matter further?Thank you kindlyMartyna",2021-08-19 17:02:08,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366381814932679!2y14413144306206891518!2m2!1i00!2i10!3e1!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sDiDbYv6IEM2X9u8P66ivoA4!7e81

I asked for a blanket as I saw them being handed out to all the women and was told there were none left, yet 2 minutes later I saw another women being handed a blanket. I asked if we could be moved to near a heater IF one became available and the server angrily said ‚Äòwe have none available‚Äô gesturing to the whole dining area. I calmly reiterated my point, and he said yes whilst storming off (he did not let me know when a table came up and I had to be asked to be moved). No one asked us how our starters or mains were, and I had to ask to have our mains cleared (after they were sat for over half an hour) AND to order dessert. Honestly I was so disappointed with the service, however the only saving grace was the food and beverage!The food was lovely, the prawns and the Halibut were cooked to perfection and the balance of flavours were amazing.

The very kind and courteous warm nature of the staff is what makes any establishment of this nature work well , with 14 Hills I can say that this was above the norm and appreciated immensely.Great music that does not overwhelm your conversation and at the same time blesses you with a good atmosphere, this pretty much is a lovely precursor to being able to enjoy the view after your meal on the very top of the building . Seeing the sun grace the sky across the city of London above the restaurant is one to remember , all of this in the midst of calm relaxed conversations all round .Thank you also to the lovely French Senegalese who was very attentive and displayed a huge bout of kindness within her role.Bless you  Mr M Campbell",2022-07-07 00:57:52,"Dear Mr Campbell,Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review and share your feedback.

I‚Äôve been so excited to try it out!Sadly from the moment I got there I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with the staff, the front of house staff ignored me for about 5 minutes, when they finally acknowledged me, they carried on with a separate conversation, which was a bit frustrating.We got seated and again there was a long delay before a server came over to greet us etc. This set the tone for the whole evening, everything about the service was very brash and slow. I asked for a blanket as I saw them being handed out to all the women and was told there were none left, yet 2 minutes later I saw another women being handed a blanket. I asked if we could be moved to near a heater IF one became available and the server angrily said ‚Äòwe have none available‚Äô gesturing to the whole dining area. I calmly reiterated my point, and he said yes whilst storming off (he did not let me know when a table came up and I had to be asked to be moved). No one asked us how our starters or mains were, and I had to ask to have our mains cleared (after they were sat for over half an hour) AND to order dessert. Honestly I was so disappointed with the service, however the only saving grace was the food and beverage!The food was lovely, the prawns and the Halibut were cooked to perfection and the balance of flavours were amazing. The cocktails were great too and the bar staff were so friendly and help when choosing a cocktail based on your flavour preference.The views and the decor are incredible and well worth a visit to the top.If the service up their game, this would be an absolutely incredible restaurant!",2021-08-19 02:20:25,"Dear Charisma,Thank you for your recent visit and for your time taking to write this review;We are sorry to hear about the lack of service you have received, however we are so pleased you did enjoy the food and drinks!Would you be able please to email us at hello@14hills.co.uk so we can investigate this matter further?Thank you kindlyMartyna",2021-08-19 17:02:08,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366381814932679!2y14413144306206891518!2m2!1i00!2i10!3e1!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sRCHbYv3YN46G9u8P-c6JkAY!7e81

I‚Äôve been so excited to try it out!Sadly from the moment I got there I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with the staff, the front of house staff ignored me for about 5 minutes, when they finally acknowledged me, they carried on with a separate conversation, which was a bit frustrating.We got seated and again there was a long delay before a server came over to greet us etc. This set the tone for the whole evening, everything about the service was very brash and slow. I asked for a blanket as I saw them being handed out to all the women and was told there were none left, yet 2 minutes later I saw another women being handed a blanket. I asked if we could be moved to near a heater IF one became available and the server angrily said ‚Äòwe have none available‚Äô gesturing to the whole dining area. I calmly reiterated my point, and he said yes whilst storming off (he did not let me know when a table came up and I had to be asked to be moved). No one asked us how our starters or mains were, and I had to ask to have our mains cleared (after they were sat for over half an hour) AND to order dessert. Honestly I was so disappointed with the service, however the only saving grace was the food and beverage!The food was lovely, the prawns and the Halibut were cooked to perfection and the balance of flavours were amazing. The cocktails were great too and the bar staff were so friendly and help when choosing a cocktail based on your flavour preference.The views and the decor are incredible and well worth a visit to the top.If the service up their game, this would be an absolutely incredible restaurant!",2021-08-19 02:20:25,"Dear Charisma,Thank you for your recent visit and for your time taking to write this review;We are sorry to hear about the lack of service you have received, however we are so pleased you did enjoy the food and drinks!Would you be able please to email us at hello@14hills.co.uk so we can investigate this matter further?Thank you kindlyMartyna",2021-08-19 17:02:08,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366381814932679!2y14413144306206891518!2m2!1i00!2i10!3e1!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sqCTbYpWiG6-J9u8PrrG6gAM!7e81

I‚Äôve been so excited to try it out!Sadly from the moment I got there I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with the staff, the front of house staff ignored me for about 5 minutes, when they finally acknowledged me, they carried on with a separate conversation, which was a bit frustrating.We got seated and again there was a long delay before a server came over to greet us etc. This set the tone for the whole evening, everything about the service was very brash and slow. I asked for a blanket as I saw them being handed out to all the women and was told there were none left, yet 2 minutes later I saw another women being handed a blanket. I asked if we could be moved to near a heater IF one became available and the server angrily said ‚Äòwe have none available‚Äô gesturing to the whole dining area. I calmly reiterated my point, and he said yes whilst storming off (he did not let me know when a table came up and I had to be asked to be moved). No one asked us how our starters or mains were, and I had to ask to have our mains cleared (after they were sat for over half an hour) AND to order dessert. Honestly I was so disappointed with the service, however the only saving grace was the food and beverage!The food was lovely, the prawns and the Halibut were cooked to perfection and the balance of flavours were amazing.

I want to take the opportunity to thank profusely the waiting staff, from the manager Stefano, who has been simply exquisite and went above and beyond with his service, to the waiter Grober, with his infectious smile, and the delightful receptionist, who has been very smiling and kind and offered me a lovely table with a view of the Thames. In addition, the food was delicious, from starters to mains, from cocktails to wine, everything pleased my palate and made my experience even better. I went to celebrate my 40th birthday with a friend and  I did feel cocooned, spoilt and very special. I was blissfully happy and couldn‚Äôt have started my 40ites in any better way.

Paid ¬£23.50 for this - which I don't mind paying as long as the quality matches the price. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Whilst the wings are huge - amongst biggest ever seen - the flavouring is minimal in the sauce and also sauce amount. Peanut butter and maple is a prime example - most of the chicken was bare with just a few goops of sauce here and there. So you're literally paying for huge chunks of chicken that have barely got any flavour. This is quite a lot to pay IMO for plain ole chicken - which I can cook at home.,2022-02-14 22:07:27,"Hi Nix!

Paid ¬£23.50 for this - which I don't mind paying as long as the quality matches the price. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Whilst the wings are huge - amongst biggest ever seen - the flavouring is minimal in the sauce and also sauce amount. Peanut butter and maple is a prime example - most of the chicken was bare with just a few goops of sauce here and there. So you're literally paying for huge chunks of chicken that have barely got any flavour. This is quite a lot to pay IMO for plain ole chicken - which I can cook at home.,2022-02-14 22:07:27,"Hi Nix!

Paid ¬£23.50 for this - which I don't mind paying as long as the quality matches the price. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Whilst the wings are huge - amongst biggest ever seen - the flavouring is minimal in the sauce and also sauce amount. Peanut butter and maple is a prime example - most of the chicken was bare with just a few goops of sauce here and there. So you're literally paying for huge chunks of chicken that have barely got any flavour. This is quite a lot to pay IMO for plain ole chicken - which I can cook at home.,2022-02-14 22:07:27,"Hi Nix!

Paid ¬£23.50 for this - which I don't mind paying as long as the quality matches the price. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Whilst the wings are huge - amongst biggest ever seen - the flavouring is minimal in the sauce and also sauce amount. Peanut butter and maple is a prime example - most of the chicken was bare with just a few goops of sauce here and there. So you're literally paying for huge chunks of chicken that have barely got any flavour. This is quite a lot to pay IMO for plain ole chicken - which I can cook at home.,2022-02-14 22:07:27,"Hi Nix!

Paid ¬£23.50 for this - which I don't mind paying as long as the quality matches the price. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Whilst the wings are huge - amongst biggest ever seen - the flavouring is minimal in the sauce and also sauce amount. Peanut butter and maple is a prime example - most of the chicken was bare with just a few goops of sauce here and there. So you're literally paying for huge chunks of chicken that have barely got any flavour. This is quite a lot to pay IMO for plain ole chicken - which I can cook at home.,2022-02-14 22:07:27,"Hi Nix!

I asked for a blanket as I saw them being handed out to all the women and was told there were none left, yet 2 minutes later I saw another women being handed a blanket.

No one asked us how our starters or mains were, and I had to ask to have our mains cleared (after they were sat for over half an hour) AND to order dessert.

The very kind and courteous warm nature of the staff is what makes any establishment of this nature work well , with 14 Hills I can say that this was above the norm and appreciated immensely.Great music that does not overwhelm your conversation and at the same time blesses you with a good atmosphere, this pretty much is a lovely precursor to being able to enjoy the view after your meal on the very top of the building . Seeing the sun grace the sky across the city of London above the restaurant is one to remember , all of this in the midst of calm relaxed conversations all round .Thank you also to the lovely French Senegalese who was very attentive and displayed a huge bout of kindness within her role.Bless you  Mr M Campbell",2022-07-07 00:57:52,"Dear Mr Campbell,Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review and share your feedback.

The booth we sat in, had a speaker directly above it, which was far too loud making myself and my friends inaudible once the band came on to play. We asked for this to be turned down and it appears we received a discretionary charge on our bill for this service (either that or charged to listen to the band which we couldn‚Äôt see from our booth).All in all, the vibe, food & cocktails were good.

This had to be signed for, on arrival, and the balloon was detached as it was against the restaurant policy üôÑ",2021-11-23 17:32:51,Thank you so much for providing feedback on your recent visit.
