I‚Äôve been so excited to try it out!Sadly from the moment I got there I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with the staff, the front of house staff ignored me for about 5 minutes, when they finally acknowledged me, they carried on with a separate conversation, which was a bit frustrating.We got seated and again there was a long delay before a server came over to greet us etc. This set the tone for the whole evening, everything about the service was very brash and slow. I asked for a blanket as I saw them being handed out to all the women and was told there were none left, yet 2 minutes later I saw another women being handed a blanket. I asked if we could be moved to near a heater IF one became available and the server angrily said ‚Äòwe have none available‚Äô gesturing to the whole dining area. I calmly reiterated my point, and he said yes whilst storming off (he did not let me know when a table came up and I had to be asked to be moved). No one asked us how our starters or mains were, and I had to ask to have our mains cleared (after they were sat for over half an hour) AND to order dessert. Honestly I was so disappointed with the service, however the only saving grace was the food and beverage!The food was lovely, the prawns and the Halibut were cooked to perfection and the balance of flavours were amazing. The cocktails were great too and the bar staff were so friendly and help when choosing a cocktail based on your flavour preference.The views and the decor are incredible and well worth a visit to the top.If the service up their game, this would be an absolutely incredible restaurant!",2021-08-19 02:20:25,"Dear Charisma,Thank you for your recent visit and for your time taking to write this review;We are sorry to hear about the lack of service you have received, however we are so pleased you did enjoy the food and drinks!Would you be able please to email us at hello@14hills.co.uk so we can investigate this matter further?Thank you kindlyMartyna",2021-08-19 17:02:08,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366381814932679!2y14413144306206891518!2m2!1i00!2i10!3e1!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdbjbYsMZj9uBBqfYgugE!7e81
