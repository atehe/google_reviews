DISGUSTING venue that made me drink ANTS.I went there on a night out with a few friends. Ordered a drink and noticed something on my ice, I assumed it was fruit remains. I carried on drinking and noticed a few things in my drink, pulled out my straw to poke it and there were DEAD ANTS all stuck to my straw, and multiple dead ants in my drink.I’ve gone to the bar to complain about this and say I wanted a whole refund for all of our drinks that we’d just ordered (our drinks were untouched at this point) and said I wanted to leave the bar in general as I felt sick and was disgusted. They refused to refund the drinks, and I had to sit uncomfortably in a venue that had just made me drink ANTS because we’d spent all our money in there. They didn’t even try to see what the problem was or how these ants had ended up dead in my drink.I then emailed head office, MONTHS later and no one has got back to me.To top it off I commented on their socials, guess what, ALL MY COMMENTS WERE DELETED.This establishment and company couldn’t get any worse. I’ve spoken to people and as soon as they heard which be at one they were they all had their own story on how disgusting that place is. Hope it gets shut down and I will continue posting these reviews until someone gets back to me.As I said on social media you can delete my comments on Instagram but you CANNOT delete Google reviews, so Goodluck.",2022-07-03 19:13:56,"C D, thank you for leaving us feedback.

First and foremost, the photos taken were really beautiful and natural, and captured the intimateness of the wedding that we had.In the lead up to the day, Adam kept in good contact with us, and arranged a few Zoom sessions (during covid times!) so we could go over keen details and get both ours and his opinions on what would work. We were really impressed by his existing knowledge of the different cultures and traditions that our heavily diverse families brought to the wedding, as well as his willingness to learn more. We think this really showed in the photos, as they were really encapsulated the different aspects that we wanted.Finally, Adam was a really nice person to talk with, and his relaxed demeanour put us at ease in the lead-up, and endeared him to our friends and family at the wedding.

Booking Matt was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding!The long version:Photography and preserving memories are incredibly important to us, that is why for our wedding one of first suppliers to book was our photographer.Despite being incredibly fussy, we spoke to a grand total of one photographer, we were sold straight away. That was Matt.You can already see from Matt's previous images, the absolute quality of his work. We initially asked for a meeting because of a shot he took at a previous wedding at our venue, but the fact that he is a funny, engaging and professional helped make our decision to pick him an easy one.On the day itself, Matt put everyone at ease, managing to take natural unobtrusive shots yet capturing everything we wanted from the day. Several of our guests commented on how friendly he was.With the weather not on our side, he already had contingency plans in place for where to take some of our more formal shots something which we didn't even have time to consider.Communication with Matt has was excellent, making sure that we were updated updated every step of the way, picking up the little things during our planning stages and even after the weeding itself.With the pictures now in our possession, we're over the moon at how well they have turned out, we can't wait to try and narrow them down to get them into an album (it will be difficult as all of them are incredible!)On a separate note, we've actually used Matt for his photography skills on three occasions now, and will see if he's available for any future events too!Thank you again Matt for all of your help capturing our journey together, you're the best.",2021-10-02 10:34:42,None,None,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221411499027922825!2y5367012591246797702!2m2!1i00!2i10!3e1!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sMhXbYrjiI4WU9u8Pve26yAo!7e81

We had so look through his portfolio and booked him! With the booking we had an engagement shoot which I highly recomend as we got to know Matt, he got to know us, we were put at ease and the photos were amazing.  On the day of the wedding Matt was very much in the background and we weren't often aware of his presence.  He had great ideas on certain photos and everyone said what a great guy he is! He got wonderful photos of all our guests and really did a class job. We have no hesitation recommending him and will to our friends when they all get engaged. We will treasure our wedding photos.  Thank you Matt for recording our special day so well! I was so impatient waiting for the finished wedding photos as the engagement shoot was so good; sorry Matt! The presentation box and USB was great and we had the flexibility to print off what we wanted to use in our album and get plenty frames and even a canvas.",2019-04-17 20:37:58,None,None,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221411499027922825!2y5367012591246797702!2m2!1i00!2i10!3e1!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sMhXbYrjiI4WU9u8Pve26yAo!7e81

He caught some lovely moments during the ceremony and the more formal pictures afterwards are gorgeous. He has an eye for what to capture and took our beautiful scenery into account too, even getting our reflections in the lake!.
