The live band are really cool, they played feel-good songs and then when their set ended, the DJ came on. I personally didn't vibe with the playlist, just super generic with no satisfying drops or transitions and I couldn't get down to party. They also charged me ¬£21 for a diet coke and a G&T which is horrendously extortionate. There are far better and cheaper nights out in Soho","Dear AndyThank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback following your recent visit to 100 Wardour Street.Firstly, I am sorry to hear that you did not receive the experience that we pride ourselves on.I am disappointed to hear that you were less than impressed with our Club.I have since shared your feedback with the team.Once again thanks again for your valued feedback and I hope we get the opportunity to welcome you back soon.Best regardsDecio Vasconcelos",2022-07-19 22:47:32,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366123372795595!2y955791083295057397!2m2!1i0!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1szYHYYuuzCYeigAbWzL6IBw!7e81

Went to get a drink at the bar.  How surprised I was when I was charged a service charge !!! For getting the drink myself ! Shame on these greedy companies,"Dear RWWR,Thank you for your review.The service charge is optional. It is not a compulsory charge.We use the optional service charge as a way of ensuring that any gratuity does not just go to the individual bartender or waiter but also for the employee who brings food to the table or the cleaner who ensures the venue is spot on for our guests' every day, as we feel that providing great experiences, service and food is a team effort.However, the service charge is optional, and we want all our guests to feel at ease if they wish for the service charge to be amended or deducted.Best RegardsDecio Vasconcelos",2022-07-19 22:51:32,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366123372795595!2y955791083295057397!2m2!1i0!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1szYHYYuuzCYeigAbWzL6IBw!7e81

The food was distinctly average, the starters were tolerable and nicely presented but the main courses were entirely bland and unexciting. My friend struggled to finish her steak (which she said was fairly chewy) and the thai green curry I ordered had very little flavour, overly large chunks of chicken and overcooked rice.The table service was rude and the waiter made a number of unwarranted comments towards the female guests, almost every time we went to order something. One friend had to order a simple lemonade twice before it was eventually received. I was also given the wrong drink.Towards the end of the night the floor staff try to shepherd everyone downstairs as they close the upstairs bar and seating areas. Despite us having a table upstairs, we were refused entry to the upstairs bar and the floor manager attempted to push my girlfriend aside whilst she was trying to get back to our table (to collect our coats and say goodbye to our friends). He did not push her but placed his hands on her to stop her moving forward, which was completely unnecessary given we had explained the situation to him. The manager not only refused to apologise for laying his hands upon her, but then suggested we should leave immediately and not be so rude. The whole incident was rather insane and unnecessary and I had to take him aside to explain the situation amd request an apology. Rather than apologise, he rudely walked away, sulking and muttering under his breath.The dancefloor was fine (although extremely sweaty) and the bar staff were all helpful and friendly. I would not eat food here again and don't expect to be treated like a human being. Ironically, the friendliest people there were the bouncers.",-,-,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366123372795595!2y955791083295057397!2m2!1i30!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1szYHYYuuzCYeigAbWzL6IBw!7e81

It was a date night for me and my wife, our son was away, and I had finally accepted I was going to miss the England match‚Ä¶The venue is fairly mad, and I imagine pretty fun if you are young and enjoy mainstream pop of the Sam Smith variety (confession: I do not) but the food‚Ä¶ the food was unforgivably bad.Including a bottle of wine & two g&ts our bill was in excess of ¬£200. Neither of us could eat more than half of our starters or mains.I had squid to start. One of my favourite dishes at German Gymnasium, but this was like some kind of cruel, crude parody. After a few mouthfuls I recalled what the taste reminded me of - Tesco frozen southern friend chicken bites that my mum used to serve up‚Ä¶. A huge portion that largely went undisturbed. My main was monkfish, which again I poked around my plate suspiciously. Rather than the meaty, flavoursome texture I‚Äôm used to I was greeted by a strange, waterlogged, spongy consistency which to be honest slightly turned my stomach. We didn‚Äôt risk a desert. We stumbled out into the streets with empty stomachs and an even emptier wallet, but at least were amused by the sight of the human pyramid that had formed on Eros in Piccadilly Circus.The staff were good and it was so loud in there I saw no point in raising any issues with them, but I did email afterwards to express concerns and got a rather perfunctory reply. That‚Äôs fine - they are a popular venue and don‚Äôt need me to keep them busy.

In addition, the food was delicious, from starters to mains, from cocktails to wine, everything pleased my palate and made my experience even better. I went to celebrate my 40th birthday with a friend and  I did feel cocooned, spoilt and very special. I was blissfully happy and couldn‚Äôt have started my 40ites in any better way.

Nice deco as usual, the food is usually good and staff great.I like the off white marble tables contrasting with the dark rich velvety purple and brown chairs. Always a nice mix of colours and textures. As always, the lovely little industrial ceiling lights come on their own as it darkens, giving a cosier atmosphere to the place.My only niggle the portions were on the smaller side and it was a tad pricey perhaps but there again you are in South Kensington. Also, I was told they have recently changed the menu, I think it shows, it needs a bit of fine tuning.Having said, the food wasn't bad, just not as good as I would have expected.The bread was good but the butter delicious. Very good taste and texture. I was told it is mixed with yogurt and it shows the creamier and smoother consistency.The crab salad was very tasty, with the mango and avocado pure√© all well balanced.The sole meuniere perhaps the weakest. Small portion  and new potatoes a bit too firm but the fish was well cooked.The chocolate delice dessert very good, the salted caramel ice cream a nice contrast with the chocolate.The staff were great and the service excellent. Special mention to my waiter on the day, Alexander, he was superb!","Dear Moises,Thank you for your detailed review.Many thanks for your mention of Alexander, he has recently joined our team and is a great new addition.There are some things you list that may need to be worked on and we will look into these.We hope to see you back with us soon.Kind regards,Ginny",2022-07-05 19:10:28,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i0!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

Here you always start off with bread and butter on the house, which I think really should be more commonplace at restaurants. I had ratatouille as my main, a traditional French dish which was delicious and nutritious, with a great variety of vegetables. The sweets too were good.

They double booked, and moved us with less than 48 hours notice to Kensington, so we had to adjust our plans a bit. We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts. I'm sure it was just a miscommunication between the branches but kind of a weird slip-up that left me with a bad taste.But as I said, the food was great.","Dear Lukas,Plainly, I am very sorry about the miscommunication and that the complimentary desserts and Champagne were not offered.Please get in touch with me (Ginny) directly via call and we will make it up to you.Kind regards,Ginny",2022-05-06 12:49:55,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i10!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

The table next to us sang along and that made the atmosphere even more special. I was truly touched. Thanks to the staff and everyone that made the occasion special.Food was excellent too. Here you always start off with bread and butter on the house, which I think really should be more commonplace at restaurants. I had ratatouille as my main, a traditional French dish which was delicious and nutritious, with a great variety of vegetables. The sweets too were good. The chocolate delice in particular was soft and rather chocolatey without being too sweet. The berry salad was a healthy and naturally delicious dessert for the summer.This place has marked special occasions of mine with such solid service, fantastic food and elegant d√©cor.

They double booked, and moved us with less than 48 hours notice to Kensington, so we had to adjust our plans a bit. We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts. I'm sure it was just a miscommunication between the branches but kind of a weird slip-up that left me with a bad taste.But as I said, the food was great.","Dear Lukas,Plainly, I am very sorry about the miscommunication and that the complimentary desserts and Champagne were not offered.Please get in touch with me (Ginny) directly via call and we will make it up to you.Kind regards,Ginny",2022-05-06 12:49:55,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i10!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

Nice deco as usual, the food is usually good and staff great.I like the off white marble tables contrasting with the dark rich velvety purple and brown chairs. Always a nice mix of colours and textures. As always, the lovely little industrial ceiling lights come on their own as it darkens, giving a cosier atmosphere to the place.My only niggle the portions were on the smaller side and it was a tad pricey perhaps but there again you are in South Kensington. Also, I was told they have recently changed the menu, I think it shows, it needs a bit of fine tuning.Having said, the food wasn't bad, just not as good as I would have expected.The bread was good but the butter delicious. Very good taste and texture. I was told it is mixed with yogurt and it shows the creamier and smoother consistency.The crab salad was very tasty, with the mango and avocado pure√© all well balanced.The sole meuniere perhaps the weakest. Small portion  and new potatoes a bit too firm but the fish was well cooked.The chocolate delice dessert very good, the salted caramel ice cream a nice contrast with the chocolate.The staff were great and the service excellent.

Here you always start off with bread and butter on the house, which I think really should be more commonplace at restaurants. I had ratatouille as my main, a traditional French dish which was delicious and nutritious, with a great variety of vegetables. The sweets too were good.

They double booked, and moved us with less than 48 hours notice to Kensington, so we had to adjust our plans a bit. We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts. I'm sure it was just a miscommunication between the branches but kind of a weird slip-up that left me with a bad taste.But as I said, the food was great.","Dear Lukas,Plainly, I am very sorry about the miscommunication and that the complimentary desserts and Champagne were not offered.Please get in touch with me (Ginny) directly via call and we will make it up to you.Kind regards,Ginny",2022-05-06 12:49:55,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i10!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

Nice deco as usual, the food is usually good and staff great.I like the off white marble tables contrasting with the dark rich velvety purple and brown chairs. Always a nice mix of colours and textures. As always, the lovely little industrial ceiling lights come on their own as it darkens, giving a cosier atmosphere to the place.My only niggle the portions were on the smaller side and it was a tad pricey perhaps but there again you are in South Kensington. Also, I was told they have recently changed the menu, I think it shows, it needs a bit of fine tuning.Having said, the food wasn't bad, just not as good as I would have expected.The bread was good but the butter delicious. Very good taste and texture. I was told it is mixed with yogurt and it shows the creamier and smoother consistency.The crab salad was very tasty, with the mango and avocado pure√© all well balanced.The sole meuniere perhaps the weakest. Small portion  and new potatoes a bit too firm but the fish was well cooked.The chocolate delice dessert very good, the salted caramel ice cream a nice contrast with the chocolate.The staff were great and the service excellent.

Here you always start off with bread and butter on the house, which I think really should be more commonplace at restaurants. I had ratatouille as my main, a traditional French dish which was delicious and nutritious, with a great variety of vegetables. The sweets too were good.

Very good taste and texture.

They double booked, and moved us with less than 48 hours notice to Kensington, so we had to adjust our plans a bit. We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts.

If you want people to frequent your establishment at the same, if not inflated prices, and add a service charge then it‚Äôs up to you to provide the best experience.Customers can live without spending their hard earned cash at restaurants, but restaurants need customers to survive.","Dear Trina,All your points have been noted and we are sorry we didn't get it right for you on this occasion.We are looking into and will work on the lack of urgency you mention, unfortunately this is a bad trait across all hospitality venues when it isn't busy.We appreciate you may not wish to return with us, but we do hope you try us again.

This is the third time I've been here and it never disappoints.Service was as always excellent. Our waitress was kind and attentive. She even sang me Happy Birthday. The table next to us sang along and that made the atmosphere even more special. I was truly touched. Thanks to the staff and everyone that made the occasion special.Food was excellent too. Here you always start off with bread and butter on the house, which I think really should be more commonplace at restaurants. I had ratatouille as my main, a traditional French dish which was delicious and nutritious, with a great variety of vegetables. The sweets too were good. The chocolate delice in particular was soft and rather chocolatey without being too sweet. The berry salad was a healthy and naturally delicious dessert for the summer.This place has marked special occasions of mine with such solid service, fantastic food and elegant d√©cor.

They double booked, and moved us with less than 48 hours notice to Kensington, so we had to adjust our plans a bit. We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts. I'm sure it was just a miscommunication between the branches but kind of a weird slip-up that left me with a bad taste.But as I said, the food was great.","Dear Lukas,Plainly, I am very sorry about the miscommunication and that the complimentary desserts and Champagne were not offered.Please get in touch with me (Ginny) directly via call and we will make it up to you.Kind regards,Ginny",2022-05-06 12:49:55,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i10!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

Nice deco as usual, the food is usually good and staff great.I like the off white marble tables contrasting with the dark rich velvety purple and brown chairs. Always a nice mix of colours and textures. As always, the lovely little industrial ceiling lights come on their own as it darkens, giving a cosier atmosphere to the place.My only niggle the portions were on the smaller side and it was a tad pricey perhaps but there again you are in South Kensington. Also, I was told they have recently changed the menu, I think it shows, it needs a bit of fine tuning.Having said, the food wasn't bad, just not as good as I would have expected.The bread was good but the butter delicious. Very good taste and texture. I was told it is mixed with yogurt and it shows the creamier and smoother consistency.The crab salad was very tasty, with the mango and avocado pure√© all well balanced.The sole meuniere perhaps the weakest. Small portion  and new potatoes a bit too firm but the fish was well cooked.The chocolate delice dessert very good, the salted caramel ice cream a nice contrast with the chocolate.The staff were great and the service excellent.

We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts. I'm sure it was just a miscommunication between the branches but kind of a weird slip-up that left me with a bad taste.But as I said, the food was great.","Dear Lukas,Plainly, I am very sorry about the miscommunication and that the complimentary desserts and Champagne were not offered.Please get in touch with me (Ginny) directly via call and we will make it up to you.Kind regards,Ginny",2022-05-06 12:49:55,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i10!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

The food was okay too (but not excellent).However, they asked for a holding deposit of ¬£110 to secure the booking. Seemed reasonable, so I did it. It was supposed to be knocked off of the bill. When the bill came, it wasn't knocked off. I was told that they rectify these issues afterwards. Suffice to say that they do not. I've emailed the original person I booked with (very responsive before I paid, not responsive at all afterwards), called the restaurant and called the reservation line. Both promised to resolve and call me back and neither did. Very poor behaviour.","Hi Martin,You have posted this review on our other restaurants pages as well...We did refund you the deposit the day after your reservation with us.If there is still an issue please get in touch with us (we have tried to call and email you numerous times but you never answer).Kind regards,Ginny",2021-11-25 11:10:25,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i30!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

Nice deco as usual, the food is usually good and staff great.I like the off white marble tables contrasting with the dark rich velvety purple and brown chairs. Always a nice mix of colours and textures. As always, the lovely little industrial ceiling lights come on their own as it darkens, giving a cosier atmosphere to the place.My only niggle the portions were on the smaller side and it was a tad pricey perhaps but there again you are in South Kensington. Also, I was told they have recently changed the menu, I think it shows, it needs a bit of fine tuning.Having said, the food wasn't bad, just not as good as I would have expected.The bread was good but the butter delicious. Very good taste and texture. I was told it is mixed with yogurt and it shows the creamier and smoother consistency.The crab salad was very tasty, with the mango and avocado pure√© all well balanced.The sole meuniere perhaps the weakest. Small portion  and new potatoes a bit too firm but the fish was well cooked.The chocolate delice dessert very good, the salted caramel ice cream a nice contrast with the chocolate.The staff were great and the service excellent.

They double booked, and moved us with less than 48 hours notice to Kensington, so we had to adjust our plans a bit. We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts. I'm sure it was just a miscommunication between the branches but kind of a weird slip-up that left me with a bad taste.But as I said, the food was great.","Dear Lukas,Plainly, I am very sorry about the miscommunication and that the complimentary desserts and Champagne were not offered.Please get in touch with me (Ginny) directly via call and we will make it up to you.Kind regards,Ginny",2022-05-06 12:49:55,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i10!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81

We were told that the group would receive ""free bubbles on arrival and free desserts"" as compensation for the change.At the Kensington branch, the food was impeccable and the service was great. However there was no mention of us being moved or the compensation offered. Instead the server offered a ""free gift"" of sparkling wine ""to the ladies but unfortunately not the men"". This was an archaic and offensive statement considering I am a non-binary person. Two out of five people at the table got the compensatory drinks.  We were also made to pay for our desserts.

The food was okay too (but not excellent).However, they asked for a holding deposit of ¬£110 to secure the booking. Seemed reasonable, so I did it. It was supposed to be knocked off of the bill. When the bill came, it wasn't knocked off. I was told that they rectify these issues afterwards. Suffice to say that they do not. I've emailed the original person I booked with (very responsive before I paid, not responsive at all afterwards), called the restaurant and called the reservation line. Both promised to resolve and call me back and neither did. Very poor behaviour.","Hi Martin,You have posted this review on our other restaurants pages as well...We did refund you the deposit the day after your reservation with us.If there is still an issue please get in touch with us (we have tried to call and email you numerous times but you never answer).Kind regards,Ginny",2021-11-25 11:10:25,https://www.google.com/maps/preview/review/listentitiesreviews?authuser=0&hl=en&gl=uk&pb=!1m2!1y5221366687347173293!2y6277324952430226391!2m2!1i30!2i10!3e2!4m5!3b1!4b1!5b1!6b1!7b1!5m2!1sdITYYpehHJOU9u8PkZy02Ak!7e81
